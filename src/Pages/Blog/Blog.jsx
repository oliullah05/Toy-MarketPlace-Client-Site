                    <ul className=''>
                        <ul> 0. PostgreSQL</ul>

                        <ul> 1. MySQL</ul>

                        <ul> 2. MongoDB</ul>

                        <ul> 3. Redis</ul>

                        <ul> 4. Apache Cassandra</ul>

                    </ul>
                    In fact, it offers the vast flexibility to use it with other libraries and is heavily influenced by Angular, React, and Vue. Thats why this framework is very popular today.It follows the principles of Dependency Injection, which helps manage the dependencies between different components of an application, Decorators, and Modules to structure and organize the application code.

    <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold'>Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</h1>
    <h1 className='underline my-6'>SQL :-</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>SQL databases are vertically scalable.</li>
        <li>SQL databases have fixed or static or predefined schema.</li>
        <li>SQL databases display data in form of tables so it is known as table-based database..</li>
        <li>SQL databases are best suited for complex queries.</li>
    </ul>


    <h1 className='underline my-6'>NoSQL :-</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.</li>
        <li>NoSQL databases have dynamic schema.</li>
        <li>NoSQL databases collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores.</li>
        <li>NoSQL databases are not so good for complex queries</li>

<h1 className="text-3xl fontbold">What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?</h1>
<p>

It serves as a proof of authentication and authorization . And A refresh token is token which create a new token for user when the original access token is expire. when the access expire  the refresh token can be sent to the authentication server to request a new access token without having to re-authenticate the user or application. We can store access token HTTP-only cookies or local or seasson storeges.

<h1 className="text-3xl fontbold">What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?</h1>
<p>
MongoDB aggregate is a powerful feature that allows you to perform advanced data analysis and transformation on your data stored in a MongoDB database. It works by providing a way to process and combine multiple documents in a collection and perform various operations on them.

Think of it like sorting, filtering, grouping, and manipulating data in a spreadsheet. With aggregate, you can perform similar operations on your MongoDB data.

You provide a set of stages or steps to the aggregate command, and each stage performs a specific operation on the documents. These stages can include operations like matching documents based on certain criteria, sorting documents, grouping them by a specific field, calculating sums or averages, and even joining data from different collections.</p>
